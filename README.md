# Gaussian Elimination

## AIM:
To write a program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Import the numpy dictionary and the sys packages to the python programming
2. Get the input from the user and call the Built in function np.zeros() to solve the matrix
3. print the solution of the matrix after solving it without any error

## Program:
```
Program to solve a matrix using Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting.

``` python

import numpy as np
import sys
n=int(input())
a=np.zeros((n,n+1))
x=np.zeros(n)
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n+1):
        a[i][j]=float(input())
for i in range(n):
    if a [i][j]==0.0:
        sys.exit("Divide by zero detected!")
    for j in range(i+1,n):
        ratio=a[j][i]/a[i][i]
        for k in range(n+1):
            a[j][k]=a[j][k]-ratio*a[i][k]
x[n-1]=a[n-1][n]/a[n-1][n-1]
for i in range(n-2,-1,-1):
    x[i]=a[i][n]
    for j in range(i+1,n):
        x[i]=x[i]-a[i][j]*x[j]
    x[i]=x[i]/a[i][i]
for i in range(n):
    print("X%d = %0.2f " %(i,x[i]),end="")

```
## Output:
![gaussian elimination](/gaussian.png)


## Result:
Thus the program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination is written and verified using python programming.
